The inevitable pile-on that happens if someone dares critique or question the platform. The passive-aggressive&mdash;and sometimes agrressive-agressive&mdash;responses don&rsquo;t do anything to push the platform forward as a viable alternative to centralized social media. Before you getting all wound up and start lecturing people about how quote posts can be used for dunking on people or how search can be used to enable harassment, maybe take a look at how your responses are creating a(n un)welcoming environment for others, or&nbsp;not.</p><p>For the record, I do like Mastodon and I don&rsquo;t have as many problems with the UI and onboarding, etc, etc as many others do (although I do see their points).  Eugene Rochko and the rest of the Mastodon devs are taking steps to address some of the more frequently-encountered and glaring UX problems people are encountering, which is great, but in the meantime, helping people onboard and get used to the way Mastodon works would seem to be a more productive course of action than getting all shouty,&nbsp;no?</p>\n",

A big part of 2018 and 2019 was spent getting myself fit and fast enough to qualify, which I did; I qualified for the 2020 Boston Marathon with a run of <a href=\"http://campegg.com/activities/1890664190\">3:03:09</a>, giving me a buffer of 6:51 under my (then) qualifying standard of 3:10:00. But then 2020 actually happened and the marathon was cancelled. The BAA allowed runners to re-apply with their 2020 qualifying times, and I was accepted to the planned 2021 running, but after that was <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-marathon/2021/05/05/boston-marathon-2021-qualifying-time/\">moved to October and the field size reduced</a>, I missed out on getting a bib by 64 seconds. Based on what I was reading at the time, the field size reductions were all at the expense of qualifying runners, not the charity slots. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs entirely true and if it is, I can understand the decision, but it still&nbsp;stung.</p><p>That whole episode pretty much cratered my motivation to train and I haven‚Äôt really done much in the way of racing since; I‚Äôm just not as willing to go out and hurt myself to race properly and if I‚Äôm not in the game mentally, I‚Äôm never going to get there physically. And then when I did begin to feel like traing properly again and started gaining some momentum, I got injured training for the NYC marathon and haven‚Äôt really bounced back from&nbsp;that.</p><p>Compounding that is the fact that for the last 2 years, every runner who has hit their qualifiying time has been accepted. (Not that I begrudge anyone their chance to run, it‚Äôs just annoying AF that I had such a big buffer and still didn‚Äôt make it.) That should probably be a positive‚Äîhey, you don‚Äôt have to try and push as hard to go way under your qualifying time!‚Äîbut given the state of my motivation, it mostly feels like another&nbsp;kick.</p><p>But so I don‚Äôt end on a negative note, it was awsome to see Australia representing in the wheelchair event, with a couple of Aussies finishing in the top ten of the elite races; Christie Dawes with 6th in the women‚Äôs and Jake Lappin with 8th in the&nbsp;men‚Äôs.</p>\n",

Their argument centers on the premise that while the various Large Language Models (LLMs) <em>sound</em> impressive, they are really just recombining existing information according to statistical probabilities, not actually analyzing or providing thoughtful&nbsp;responses.</p><blockquote><p>LLMs are the latest wave of artificial intelligence hype. IBM&rsquo;s Dr. Watson was supposed to revolutionize health care. Ten years and $15 billion later, it was sold for parts. Radiologists were supposed to be obsolete by 2021; there are now more radiologists than ever. Fully self-driving cars were supposed to be zipping back and forth between Los Angeles and New York by 2017; we&rsquo;re still waiting for a car that can drive down a street reliably avoiding <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/08/23/silicon-valleys-driverless-car-dream-road-disaster/\">pedestrians, bicyclists and construction crews</a>.</p></blockquote><p>One could certainly mount the argument that &ldquo;AI&rdquo; (which is really a shitty catch-all term) will get better over time, and proponents of the technology will posit that feeding them more information will only make them stronger. But detractors will make the case that as the volume of AI-generated crap (disinformation, falsehoods, etc) accounts for an ever-growing proportion of the information ingested into the models, they will actually get less reliable over&nbsp;time.</p><p>I suspect the truth, as always, lies somewhere in the&nbsp;middle.</p>\n",

Firstly, you could sub out &ldquo;IOT&rdquo; for &ldquo;AI&rdquo; and the core premise would hold up. Then there was this quote from Henry Kim, an executive at LG, about consumer&nbsp;behavior:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe challenge is that a consumer doesn‚Äôt see the true value that manufacturers see in terms of how that data can help them in the long run. So they don‚Äôt really care for spending time to just connect&nbsp;it.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>This strikes me as more than a little tone deaf‚Ä¶ I think the value element is certainly a big consideration in consumers not connecting their &ldquo;smart&rdquo; appliances, but surely a significant contributing factor is that <em>people just don&rsquo;t trust manufacturers to not abuse the data from connected appliances</em>. The value of the convenience offered by a connected device just doesn&rsquo;t outweigh having your usage data indiscriminately sold to advertisers (and possibly even less trustworthy actors). If manufacturers used my data to actually add value to my life and not as an additional revenue stream, I&rsquo;d be more likely to spend the time to connect my &ldquo;smart&rdquo;&nbsp;products.</p>\n",

The compulsion to show &lsquo;balance&rsquo; by always referring to AI&rsquo;s alleged potential for good should be dropped by acknowledging that the social benefits are still speculative while the harms have been empirically&nbsp;demonstrated.</p></blockquote><p>For the record, I&rsquo;m not saying we should abandon the technology or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite\">take sledgehammers to the servers</a>, just that there should be more attention paid to the ethical implications of its use. (But like that&rsquo;s going to happen when there&rsquo;s money to be&nbsp;made.)</p>\n",

They don‚Äôt regard themselves as inhabiting the world the way other people do; they‚Äôre secret royalty, detached from society‚Äôs expectations and unfailingly outraged when faced with normal consequences for bad decisions. Society, and especially economics, is a logic puzzle where you just have to find the right set of loopholes to win the game. Rules are made to be slipped past, never stopping to consider why someone might have made those rules to start with. Silicon Valley has an ethics problem, and ‚ÄòHacker‚Äô ‚ÄòNews‚Äô is where it‚Äôs easiest to see.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Like just about any site that allows people to contribute their thoughts&mdash;reading through the commentary can be soul-sucking at times; there&rsquo;s a constant undertone of everyone wanting to prove that they&rsquo;re smarter than everyone else, combined with a faux hyper-rational-libertarian bent (which <a href=\"https://campegg.com/notes/20220406140102\">I already have feelings about</a>) that can, at times, lean uncomfortably close to misogyny and racism.
